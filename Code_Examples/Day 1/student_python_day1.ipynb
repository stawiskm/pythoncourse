    "### Functions\n",
    "Functions in Python allow you to encapsulate reusable blocks of code. They take input arguments (if any) and can return a value (or not). You can define your own functions using the `def` keyword. Here's an example of a function that calculates the sum of two numbers:\n",

    "## Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numeric Types\n",
    "Python supports several numeric types, including integers (`int`), floating-point numbers (`float`), and complex numbers (`complex`). Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Integer\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "# Floating-point number\n",

    "\n",
    "# Complex number\n",
    "z = 2 + 3j\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strings\n",
    "Strings are used to represent text data in Python. You can define strings using either single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`\"`). Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "message = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can perform various operations on strings, such as concatenation (`+`), slicing, and accessing individual characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Booleans\n",
    "Booleans represent the truth values `True` or `False`. They are often used in conditions and logical operations. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "is_valid = True\n",
    "is_invalid = False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lists\n",
    "Lists are ordered collections of items, which can be of different types. You can create a list by enclosing comma-separated values in square brackets (`[]`). Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access individual items in a list using their index and perform various operations, such as adding or removing items.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sets\n",
    "Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. You can create a set by enclosing comma-separated values in curly braces (`{}`). Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "colors = {\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets support mathematical set operations like union, intersection, and difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictionaries\n",
    "Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. Each value is associated with a unique key, allowing efficient retrieval of data. You can create a dictionary by enclosing key-value pairs in curly braces (`{}`). Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "person = {\n",
    "    \"name\": \"John\",\n",
