## Getting Started

To get started with the Python course, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Additionally, you might need a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- **Lecture_Notes**: This folder contains detailed lecture notes for each module covered in the course. You'll find comprehensive explanations, code snippets, and examples to help you grasp the concepts effectively.

- **Code_Examples**: Here, you'll discover a wide range of code examples that complement the lecture notes. These examples demonstrate various concepts and techniques, helping you solidify your understanding through hands-on practice.

- **Assignments**: The assignments folder holds all the assignments for the course. Each assignment is placed in a separate subfolder and accompanied by detailed instructions. This is where you can apply what you've learned and showcase your coding skills.

## Lecture Notes

In the [Lecture_Notes](Lecture_Notes) folder, you'll find organized subfolders for each module. These subfolders contain detailed lecture notes in Markdown format. Markdown allows for easy formatting, making it convenient to read online or offline. Feel free to explore and deepen your understanding of each module's content.

## Code Examples

The [Code_Examples](Code_Examples) folder is packed with practical code snippets. These examples align with the lecture notes and cover a wide spectrum of topics. Whether you're looking for a quick reference or hands-on practice, these code examples are an invaluable resource.

## Assignments

The [Assignments](Assignments) folder contains individual subfolders for each assignment. Inside each subfolder, you'll find a detailed assignment prompt, requirements, and any necessary resources. Complete these assignments to reinforce your learning and gain practical experience.
